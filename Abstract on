Effective water management in farming is crucial for sustainable agriculture. Key practices include proper land shaping to control water flow, encouraging direct seeding of water-intensive crops, efficient fallow management, water harvesting through techniques like ponds and tanks, aquifer recharge, and creating buffer zones near streams and rivers to prevent pollution. These practices contribute to good yields and nutrient balances on farms. Additionally, regulations such as the "Farming rules for water" in England aim to reduce diffuse water pollution from agricultural sources.
